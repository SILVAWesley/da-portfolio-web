## About this project

As a digital artist, it is very important to show your work in a way that interested people and companies
can get in touch with you. That being said, it is very handy to have a website that is indexed by 
search engines, have a great performance, is accessible, reliable and responsive.
That's where this **website** built with **SvelteKit** comes into place. It uses a [strapi CMS](https://github.com/SILVAWesley/da-portfolio-cms) to get content,
serve the client and prerender pages. While offering:

- Internationalization (in english and brazilian portuguese)
- Image storage in an S3 Bucket
- Full CI/CD with Github Actions ([checkout the deployment workflow file](.github/workflows/deploy.yaml))
- Deployment on Vercel
- Unit tests using Vitest
- End to end tests using Playwright
- ESLint/Prettier as linting and formating tools
- Husky, commitzen and commitlint to help maintaining the patterns
